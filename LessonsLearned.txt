GameLogic Class:
Tried to experiment with a GameLogic class where all the logic is stored like: 
when score === 3, then spawn invaders. However the GameLogic class needs to check all the time, so every frame
if an event is true. Therefore I putted all the logic in the update() method. So as long as the score === 3,
the game keeps spawning invaders.
Therefore I return to the previous way and this is: Bullet spawn > hit Invader (true) > 
mark bullet for deletion > update score (once) because bullet is removed after first hit > spawn invaders.
